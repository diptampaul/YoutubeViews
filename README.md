Before running the Python File make sure you have tor and tor is already running in background. Then run

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Also we need Geckodriver 0.24.0 : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.24.0


Once all the requirements are successfully installed, run

python3 YoutubeViews.py

Now give the Youtube URL, number of views you want and watchtime in seconds. Write in the Given Format only

https://youtu.be/VT6cQhksHhw 5-400 [It like (youtube_link [space] number of views [dash] watchtime in seconds)]

**Note: If the browser ask you to sign in first, then this bot will try to skip that part, if it fails it will tell you to do it manually for the first time, so open the terminal to check all the steps.
